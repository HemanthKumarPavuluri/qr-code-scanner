**Project Structure**<br>

**1. Frontend**<br>
  The Frontend folder contains all the code for the client-side of the application. It uses Vite as a build tool and React for building the user interface. Vite offers a fast development experience and optimized builds for production.<br>

**Key Components**:<br>
**src/:** The source folder where the main React components, hooks, and utility functions are located.<br>
**App.jsx:** This is the main component that acts as the entry point of the application. It renders the UI, and is responsible for rendering other components such as the QR scanner and results.<br>
**components/:** A directory for all reusable components (like a QR code scanner component, buttons, or modals).<br>
**pages/:** This folder contains the main views or pages like the home page, dashboard, and QR code results.<br>
**assets/:** A folder where static files such as images or icons are stored.<br>
**hooks/:** Custom hooks for handling data fetching or managing component state can be stored here.<br>
**utils/:** Utility functions like API calls, validation, or formatting logic reside here.<br>
**styles/:** Global CSS or SASS files for theming and styling the application.<br>
**package.json:** Contains project dependencies, like react, vite, and other frontend libraries such as axios for API calls, and react-router for page navigation.<br>
**vite.config.js:** Configuration file for the Vite build tool. It defines how the frontend code is compiled and served during development or production.<br>

**Frontend Features**:<br>
**QR Code Scanning:** The frontend includes a QR code scanner component, using libraries like react-qr-reader to capture and process QR codes.<br>
**UI/UX:** Modern and responsive user interface that allows users to scan QR codes and see results dynamically.<br>
**API Integration**:The frontend communicates with the backend through API endpoints (for instance, to send scanned QR code data to the server).<br>
**State Management:** You can use hooks like useState, useEffect or a state management library like Redux to handle the appâ€™s global state.<br>

**2. Backend**<br>
The Backend folder contains server-side code that handles API requests and database operations. It uses Node.js with Express for handling the server logic and MongoDB as the database for storing and retrieving scanned QR code data.<br>

**Key Components**:<br>
**index.js:** This is the main entry point for the server. It sets up the Express server, connects to the MongoDB database, and defines the routes for handling API requests.<br>
**Express Server Setup:** Handles incoming HTTP requests (like POST requests when a QR code is scanned).<br>
**MongoDB Connection:** Uses the MongoDB Node.js Driver or Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database. The connection details are fetched from the environment file.<br>
**Routes:** Defines API routes for handling frontend requests (e.g., saving scanned QR code data to MongoDB).<br>
**env file:** This file stores environment variables such as:
**MONGO_URI:** The connection string to your MongoDB database.
**PORT:** The port on which the server will run.<br>

**Backend Features**:<br>
**RESTful API:** The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, and storing data related to scanned QR codes.<br>
**MongoDB Integration:** Data such as scanned QR codes and user information (if needed) are stored in the MongoDB database.<br>
**Environment Variables**:Sensitive information, like the MongoDB connection string, is kept in the .env file to ensure security.<br>
**Data Validation:** Uses validation libraries like Joi or custom validation to ensure the integrity of the data sent by the frontend.<br>

**Workflow**:<br>
**User Interaction:** The user interacts with the frontend, scanning a QR code.<br>
**API Request**:The frontend sends a request to the backend API with the scanned QR code data.<br>
**Database Operations:** The backend handles this request, saves the data to MongoDB, and may send back a response, like confirmation or a record of the scanned code.<br>
**Display Results:** The frontend processes the response from the backend and display the appropriate information (e.g., the decoded data from the QR code).
